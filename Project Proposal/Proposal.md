# Software Development Project - Proposal

# Project Management Data Processing Software

# Purpose
The purpose of the proposed software is to address an ineffective and inefficient data processing functionality gap between 
project management software and cost data in corporate ERP. There is currently no quick data processing tool which serves as 
‘cost integrator’ between Oracle Primavera P6, a  powerful, high functioning schedule and earned value software, and the 
institutional Oracle ERP. The current cost integration tool in use has not been upgraded since the 1990’s and requires weeks 
of labor hours to populate.

# Pain point
 

# Detailed Technical Scope
A simple software program to take time phased data schedule from Oracle Primavera P6 and process the basic earned value metrics. The software will also generate graphical representations of project data for example, project s-curves.  The processed data will then be accessible via a web application which allows the user different views of the project data.
Conceptual component design:
                Web based user interface to access project portfolio (HTML5/CSS)
                Data processing software (Python)
                API to connect the two programs
The proof of concept design would allow the use to connect to an Excel file with the relevant data.
